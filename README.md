# SOS-LED-via-Potentiometer
 Use potentiometer to adjust the brightness of the LED.
 In this application, we hope to apply it to the following scenario. Care about your eyes when using your smartphone/pad.

 – derive a circuit to read the value from potentiometer (and show the value in serial monitor)
 – derive another circuit to show SOS via LED (refer to Quiz 1) and its brightness should be according to the value of the potentiometer
 
 Hint:
 Circuit 1. Derive a circuit to read potentiometer
         2. Derive a circuit to show SOS via LED
